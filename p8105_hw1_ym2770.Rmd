I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3
#### Data frame and plot

The code chunk below creates a data frame and generates a plot.
```{r plot_example, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500,mean = 2,sd = 4),
  y = 3 - 4.2 * x + rnorm(500)
)

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()

```

This plot is really great. It shows a linear relation just as expected.

The data frame has `r nrow(plot_df)` rows.

Here is a list:

* This is my first list item
* lists need at least two items
  * this list has a sub item
* Third list item

##### Table

Col 1 | Col 2
